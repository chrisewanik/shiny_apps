BABIP is essential because the frequency with which a player gets a hit on a ball in play or allows a hit on a ball in play is very telling. Three main factors influence BABIP; all three tell us something important about that playerâ€™s overall stat line. Those factors are defence, luck, and talent level. For hitters, we use BABIP as a sanity test that tells us if their overall batting line is sustainable. Virtually no MLB hitter can regularly produce a BABIP of .380 (CCBC tops is around .425) or higher, and anything in the .230 range is also very atypical for a major league hitter. In other words, BABIP allows us to see if a hitter seems to be getting a boost from poor defence or good luck or getting docked for facing good defences and having bad luck. Most people familiar with BABIP have a pretty good idea about why itâ€™s essential, but using it responsibly and appropriately is much more challenging. We know that the league average BABIP is almost always right around .300 (.225 in the CCBC), so many people look at a playerâ€™s BABIP, and if it is significantly different from .300, they assume that the player is either very lucky or very unlucky. This is not always the appropriate way to think about BABIP. For hitters, you typically want to adjust your expectations toward that playerâ€™s career average rather than the league average. Batters have much more control over their BABIP than pitchers, which is another way of saying that a higher percentage of batter BABIP is controlled by actual talent levels. Itâ€™s certainly possible for hitters to improve their offensive game and raise their BABIP, but short, dramatic spikes are usually due to luck."),

While batting average, on-base percentage, and slugging percentage fall short in accuracy and scope, wOBA measures and captures offensive value more accurately and comprehensively. In most situations, OPS and wOBA will lead you to similar conclusions. However, if you care about determining how well a player contributes to run scoring, wOBA is a more accurate representation of that contribution. OPS undervalues getting on base relative to hitting for extra bases and does not correctly weigh each type of extra-base hit. wOBA is based on a simple concept: Not all hits are created equal. Batting average assumes that they are, and on-base percentage does too, but is more accurate by including other ways of reaching base such as walking or being hit by a pitch. Slugging percentage weighs hits, but not accurately (Is a double worth twice as much as a single? In short, no) and again ignores other ways of reaching base. On-base plus slugging (OPS) does attempt to combine the different aspects of hitting into one metric, but it assumes that one percentage point of SLG is the same as that of OBP. A handy estimate is that OBP is around twice as valuable as SLG (the exact ratio is x1.8)."),

A .300 average with very few extra base hits is quite different from a .300 average with 40 home runs. The same is true of a .500 slugging percentage driven by many singles versus one driven by many doubles and home runs. ISO tells you the average number of extra bases a player gets per at bat, and this is a piece of information you want to know.

Using wRC+ is even easier because the league average for position players is always 100. If a player has a 110 wRC+, you know they are ten percentage points better than the league average offensively.
